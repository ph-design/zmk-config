## About PH-Lite

**PH-Lite** is what we call the nRF52840-based wireless controller shield used in our keyboards. 

### Why "Lite"?

When we decided to build a wireless keyboard, we spent 3 months developing a custom wireless solution and another 6 months writing the firmware from scratch. However, due to the slow progress, we decided to migrate to ZMK firmware instead. This allowed us to focus on what matters most - creating great keyboards - while leveraging the solid foundation that ZMK provides.
